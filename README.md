# Java Projects

This repository contains two Java-based projects: **ECART** and **Library Management System**.  
Both projects are built using **Java (Core/Advanced concepts)** and demonstrate object-oriented programming, user interaction, and basic data management.

## üìå Project 1: ECART

### Overview
ECART is a simple **shopping cart application** that allows users to:
- Browse and select items.
- Add items to the cart.
- View the list of selected products.
